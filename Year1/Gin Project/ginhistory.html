            The origins of gin are traced back to the Netherlands in the 1200s. There, the drink was originally called Genever and was made by
        distilling malt wine to 50% Alcohol by Volume (ABV). Unfortunately, the taste of Genever was not particularly pleasant,
        so to make it drinkable, spices and herbs were added. Juniper Berries, specifically, the Common Juniper <i>(juniper communius)</i>
        was added for its supposed medical properties. The berry (while not actually being a berry, more it is a fleshy cone called a Galbulus)
        is the predominant flavor that you will taste in gin.

            Genever was first exposed to English soldiers, when during the 80 Years war, they assisted the Dutch against the Spanish and consequently,
        brought back with them to England. Distillers in England began to distill their own version of genever, shortening the name to simply "Gin".
        When William the Orange, a prince from the Dutch Republic, became King of England in 1688, duties were raised on the import of brandy.
        This was in large part due to religious tensions, with the King of England being a Protestant and the King of France,
        Louise XIV, being a Catholic. Brandy had largly been one of Englands biggest imports, when by the 1680s, 2 million gallons a year were being
        imported.

            Between 1690 and 1720, the English parliament heavily encouraged production of gin, largely to reduce consumption of Wine and Brandy from
        France. Gin eventually began to be seen as a patriotic drink, even if it failed to overtake beer consumption. Restrictions on distilling were
        reduced, allowing for almost anyone to commercially distill gin, provided required taxes were paid. In London and the surrounding area alone,
        there were 1,500 stills by 1736. By 1720, taxed production of gin was at 2.5 million gallons (9.46 million liters). Whether the reported
        figures were accurate or not, they did contribute toward moral anxiety on the amount being consumed.

           The gin craze of the early 18th century, was based on the belief that gin was being abused by, not just men, but also by women and
        children. The most famous imagery from this period, is William Hogarth's 1751 etching <br> <i>Gin Lane</i>, likely inspired by descriptions
        during the period, that painted a bleak picture of Britain that was descending into a gin addicted choas. The first act of prohibition that the
        goverment passed, was aimed at the retailers, raising duties thirtyfold, adding a 20 pound licencing fee and a 10 pound fine for selling it on
        the streets. However, the act was repealed 4 years later, in 1733, because of the difficulty that the police were facing to enforce the law.
    </p>

    <p>    Up until the 1750s, multiple laws were enacted, each aiming to curb production and consumption of gin. These laws however, did nothing to
        dissuade the English population from consuming gin in record numbers, with 3.8 million gallons produced in 1730, 6.4 million gallons in 1735,
        with a record 8.2 million gallons produced, equivalent to more than a gallon per person for the English population at the time. Eventually, the
        gin craze subsided. This could have been largely in part due to less oppressing regulations or that grain shortages of the late 1750s led to
        distilling being banned to ensure food production could continue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the 1750s, gin never regained the popularity it once had.
